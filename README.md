# Lucky-BirthDate
### How this App works
1. It is a very simple app there is no any astronomical features used and do not take it too seriously.
2. It simple divides the date of birth with lucky number we provided.
3. As we know that inputs are taken as string we are typecasting to change their data type to integer.
4. Dates contain "-" and we replace it with blank like " " and that is how we get the only the and sum it up then divide it with lucky number.
